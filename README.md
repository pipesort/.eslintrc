### Opinionated eslint config for REACT app

This repo has `.eslintrc.js` that you could use for your react app (typescript) whether it is CRA or nextjs app.

If you're a reviewer probably you had to tell your teammate to name a file or variable in certain way.
Probably you had a eslint already setup, but may be you didn't check for custom eslint rules.
This config is currently being used in my projects internally with my team.

There is also corresponding screencasts [ Youtube series ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABuQbVFtFy4&list=PLg7jBfMc_r0swUIJu3o7gROy9LDoHLXaa) where the reasoning for each of these linting rules have been made.
You could see the commit history.

Please note this is an opinonated `.eslintrc` there is no right or wrong rules. :cheers:
